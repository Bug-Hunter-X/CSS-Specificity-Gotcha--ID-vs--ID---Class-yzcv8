The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
#my-element {
  color: blue;
}

.my-element {
  color: red;
}

#my-element.my-element {
  color: green;
}
```

In this scenario, the element with the id "my-element" also has the class "my-element". The expected behavior might be that the most specific selector (`#my-element.my-element`) should override the others, resulting in green text.  However, due to how CSS specificity works, the ID selector (`#my-element`) has higher specificity than the combined ID and class selector, making the text blue instead of green. This is counterintuitive to some developers.
