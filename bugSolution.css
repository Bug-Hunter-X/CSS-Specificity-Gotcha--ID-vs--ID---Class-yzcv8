To solve the specificity issue and ensure the "green" style is applied, one option is to use the `!important` flag:

```css
#my-element {
  color: blue;
}

.my-element {
  color: red;
}

#my-element.my-element {
  color: green !important;
}
```

Using `!important` should force the green color, but is generally discouraged for maintainability reasons.

A better solution is to refactor your CSS to avoid such conflicts by using more descriptive class names, or improving overall CSS structure and reducing the number of conflicts.
